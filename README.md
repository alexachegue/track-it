## Project Overview
My app will provide logging features for servers and other freelance workers to track their cash tips and income. Its purpose is to provide an income book for servers and tipped employees that is intuitive for them to use in order to accurately track cash tips for budgeting and tax preparation. This aims to help servers or other freelance workers to prevent incomplete records and underreporting or overpaying taxes. It’s designed for servers and bartenders primarily.

## Core Features
- Create, edit, and delete individual shift entries with date, hours worked, cash tips, credit
card tips, and hourly wages
- View earnings breakdown by day/week/month with visual charts
- Identify best and worst work days
- Compare earnings to other servers (opt-in feature)
- Calculate how much tax should be set aside
